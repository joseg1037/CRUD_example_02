# CRUD_example_02

This is another CRUD example also using C# and .Net Framework 4.7.2.
It is also designed with the MVC pattern and database-first architecture and uses ADO.Net to get connected to a Microsoft SQL Server database called "Owners".
Inside the database there is another 1...N relationship (Like in the example 01, but this time Owner...Cars).
It also includes a Client-sided validation using the razor markup sintax supported in HTML5.
